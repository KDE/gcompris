"In a vertical subtraction, numbers are written one below the other. They "
"need to be lined-up properly, starting from the column on the right-hand "
"side. The top number is called the minuend: it is the amount that we are "
"starting with, that another number is being subtracted from to get the "
"difference. The number below is called the subtrahend: it is the amount to "
"substract from the minuend to get the difference. The result is written on "
"the bottom line. To solve the subtraction, start by subtracting the bottom "
"number of the first column from the top number of the first column (on the "
"right-hand side), and write the result on the bottom line of the same "
"column. If the top number is smaller than the bottom number, you can borrow "
"from the subtrahend on the next column: for example, if you add 10 units to "
"the top number, you need to add one unit to the bottom number of the next "
"column. This is called the borrowing by compensation method. To do that in "
