"can think of prime numbers as very small families: they only ever have two "
"people in them! Only themselves and 1. You can't fit any other numbers into "
"them with nothing left over. 5 is one of these lonely numbers (only 5 × 1 = "
"5), but you can see that 6 has 2 and 3 in its family as well (6 × 1 = 6, 2 × "
"3 = 6). So 6 is not a prime number."
