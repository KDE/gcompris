"The factors of a number are all the numbers that divide that number evenly. "
"For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 4 is not a factor of 6 "
"because 6 cannot be divided into 4 equal pieces. If one number is a multiple "
"of a second number, then the second number is a factor of the first number. "
"You can think of multiples as families, and factors are the people in those "
"families. So 1, 2, 3 and 6 all fit into the 6 family, but 4 belongs to "
