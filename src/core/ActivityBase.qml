/**
 * The base QML component for activities in GCompris.
 * @ingroup components
 *
 * Each activity should be derived from this component. It is responsible for
 *
 * * Activity common key handling,
 * * unified audio handling,
 * * screen switching dynamics (from/to Menu/DialogHelp/etc.)
 *
 * The following common keys are handled so far:
 *
 * * @c Ctrl+w: Exit the current activity and return to the menu,
 *              or close the application if on the menu page.
 * * @c Back:   Same as above.
 * * @c Escape: Same as above.
 *
 * Cf. Template.qml for a sample skeleton activity.
 *
 * Cf.
 * [the wiki](https://gcompris.net/wiki/Qt_Quick_development_process#Adding_a_new_activity)
 * for further information about creating a new activity.
