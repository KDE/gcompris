It is also the largest of all the three pyramids in Giza. It is situated in the Giza Necropolis, in Egypt. The initial construction has been started by Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, then it was continued by his son Khafre and finally completed by Menkaure. It took almost 20 years to build the pyramid and approximately 2 million blocks of stone have been used in the construction. The height of the pyramid is approximately 139 meters making it the highest pyramid of Egypt."),

One theory holds that due to the steepness of the original angle the weight to be added above the inner chambers and passageways became too large, forcing the builders to adopt a shallower angle. Today, the Bent Pyramid is the only pyramid in Egypt of which the outer casing of polished limestone is still largely intact."),
