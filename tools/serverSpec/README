Principal:
pdfBuild.py allows to create a pdf from a collection of issues created within invent.kde.org, the kde gitlab environment.
Working with gitlab and its issues fonctionnality allows to provide to a team an environment to collaborate while working on a specification. Comments can be used and old design are stored for logging purpose.
Using pdfBuild.py ensures to always have the latest specification.

Packages and modules to install in order to run pdfBuild.py :

- pdflaxtex needs to be installed with the following command:
sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra

- pylatex needs to be installed with the following command:
pip install pylatex

How it works:
pdfBuild.py extracts first the GCompris specification structure from the following invent wiki page:
https://invent.kde.org/education/gcompris/-/wikis/GComprisCPSpec/gcompris-control-panel-specification

The structure is provided by a list of wiki links pointing to issues:
example:
- [Main screen overview](https://invent.kde.org/education/gcompris/-/issues/3)
- [Connecting devices](https://invent.kde.org/education/gcompris/-/issues/5)
- [Following results](https://invent.kde.org/education/gcompris/-/issues/6)

In this example the first link points to the invent issue number 3. This one contains the text to be displayed in the final pdf specification and its illustrations.
Illustrations are stored into what is called issues designs and are uploaded and updated directly within the issues interface.

In order to get the wiki content, the scipt is using git to download the file https://invent.kde.org/education/gcompris.wiki.git .

bugs:
It is sometimes necessary to run the script twice to avoid the following file reading error.
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './gcompris.wiki/GComprisCPSpec/GCompris-control-panel-specification.md'
The second time git will correctly download the files needed.
This bug needs to be investigated

Usage:
python pdfBuild.py --wikiurl https://invent.kde.org/education/gcompris.wiki.git --outputFilename myGCSpecificationFile.pdflaxtex

additional oprions to gain creation time are:
--doNotDownloadWiki to use the wiki file already downloaded locally;
--doNotDownloadIssuesImages to use the issues images files already downloaded locally.

Improvements:
Iutput files should be generated in a dedicated output directory.
