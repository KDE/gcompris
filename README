                  GCompris is a GNU package
                     https://gcompris.net

GCompris is a high quality educational software suite, including a large
number of activities for children aged 2 to 10. Some of the activities
are game orientated, but still educational.

Currently GCompris offers more than 100 activities, and more are
being developed. GCompris is free software, it means that you can
adapt it to your own needs, improve it and, most importantly, share it
with children everywhere.

This version is a full rewrite of GCompris using the QtQuick technology.

			 GCompris MOTIVATION

Big Issue:
  There are many simple activities dedicated to children on any
  platforms, desktops, web and tablets. When they exist, they are hard
  to find and request the teacher/parent to manage a lot of
  independant small tools.


Big Goal:
  Build an educational game suite all accessible from a single user interface.
  GCompris provides a simple to use user interface that makes it easy to select
  appropriate activities.

How:
  GCompris is designed in a way that it is easy to add new activities to it.
  The activity is free to implement the game scheme it wants.
  The status bar is a common facility provided to the activities.

  GCompris provides some tools for teachers/educators to easily add activities.
